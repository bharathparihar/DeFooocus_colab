Date: 2026-02-06
Iteration: 0.1.1

## Current Focus: Seller Dashboard
We are currently focusing on the **Seller Dashboard**, ensuring the modular components (`Profile`, `Content`, `Leads`, `Advanced`) are fully functional and parity-checked against the monolithic `App.tsx`.

## Completed
- [x] Project structure analyzed.
- [x] Identified modular components in `@/components/dashboard`.
- [x] Created `PLAN_0.1.md`.

## In Progress
- [ ] Parity check for `ProfileTab.tsx`.
- [ ] Parity check for `ContentTab.tsx`.
- [ ] Integration of "Preview" mode within the modular structure.

## Next Steps
1. Finish the **Profile Tab** refinements (Stats, Branding, Info).
2. Move to the **Content Tab** (Products, Services, Gallery).
3. Verify the **Preview** (Buyer View) functionality.
